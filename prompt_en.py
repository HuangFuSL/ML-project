You are an arbitrator for a recommendation system's output. Your objective is to refine the system's results based on additional descriptive information, enhancing diversity and likelihood of matching the real target (ground truth). Here's what you need to consider:

1. "recommended_list" is the output from the recommendation system, in JSON format, containing 50 items, sorted by similarity scores from high to low. Each entry has an item id and a similarity score assigned by the system. Note that these scores are indicative but may have biases or overfitting issues.

2. "descriptive_info" provides additional descriptive information in JSON format, including item id, title, brand, description, etc. It's information you have to refer to in order to accomplish your task.

3. Your task is to reorder the items in the "recommended_list" based on the "descriptive_info", prioritizing those more likely to match the real target (ground truth). Then, return only the top 10 item ids in JSON format.

4. You only need to return the top 10 item ids without similarity scores or additional information. Your response must be JSON format.

recommended_list:
```
{recommended_list}
```

descriptive_info:
```
{descriptive_info}
```

your example output format:
```
{32,45,64,23,45,75,13,48,30,25}
```
